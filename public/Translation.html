<h1>Translation of a Lavanic Scroll</h1>
<p>here is my translation of the lavanic poem from the scroll above.</p>

 <p> we saw the greater force, we saw the weaker force. as the stronger prevailed the weaker was slowed. lo the destruction of the strong is so great it stops the great force, and the destruction of the weak is so weak it prevails. Balance is achieved as soon as it is disrupted. Two equal forces are unequal together. unequal forces are equal together. something slips into the perfect harmonies, and one is above and one below.</p?

 <p>The two that made the three that made the one that was nothing. the two that was one, the one that was three, the one that was empty. the emptiness grows, the growth empties. The emptiness moves forward and severed. those severed things defined themselves, and hollowed. they pressed against the outer world, the outer world broke them open. opened, they yet defined again. their open body shared that definition with another open body. one body, opened and closed, they released. this definition, nearly lost was caught, again and again. even into that maw, of the one that is two, the one that is three, the one that is empty did it live, by emptying itself and giving, by releasing and dividing.</p>

 <p> lo down that river of forces does it prevail, between the spaces of battling currents. it makes it paths alongside great swells, to dwell in their open bellies. then moving again, it evades the traps of rigidity. in destructive turbulence it hides in gaps, in monotony it lies dormant.</p>

 <p> beast of great force, you will multiply, beast of winding paths you will travel, beast entangled you will escape. there are those that are killed, separated, trapped. the killed are free, the separate are free, the trapped are free.</p>

<p>It hits with more impact in the original language. you can't help but get repetitive when you lose all the specific drama of the brushwork.</p>

 <p>the context of this is that there is no other context. Most Lavanic poems are illustrated. because Lavanic characters are essentially pictographs, if one wants to be specific they might as well draw what is happening. Because there are no illustrations, we can assume the subject is abstract. The large character at the bottom left gives away the subject, with the dramatic waves accentuating out main character, the "beast" at the end that appears as this circular shape. circles are shorthand for some defined object, everything else is some kind of force, except for a,e,g and y type shapes, which describe a kind of middle ground between force and matter.</p>

 <p>I hesitate to make any assertion about the meaning of this poem, because my own preconceived notions serve as the context that color the rest of the interpretation. I made it more about the creation of life, but it could be about an inorganic phenomenon, or maybe it is part of a larger poem and there is some specific context we are missing. </p>
