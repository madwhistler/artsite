<p>here is an example of drawing in bear. You can judge for yourself if it has to do with the golden ratio. A lot of things can come "close enough" to the golden ratio to count in our pattern-seeking brains. This is how I think about it, the patterns that come from the golden ratio exist within the bounds of certain number systems. These number systems describe some aspects of the physical world but not all of them. All fractals are bears, but no one is THE bear. below is an advanced iteration of the former sequence.  </p>
<p>you can start to see the fractal pattern, but you might see it better if I started larger and continued with the detail. You may also notice the lines start to change shape as they get smaller. This is because the first shapes are in bear to the rectangle while the latter and in bear to the first shapes. </p>
