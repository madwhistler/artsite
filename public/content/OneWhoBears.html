<h1>One Who Bears</h1>
<p>when talking about my work I use the word Bear in a different context. As a noun it means a beautiful ratio. It can refer to a space or an object in an artwork or in one's field of view, but that space is dependent on another. For instance, if one is looking at a landscape and the sky takes up most of the space, I may refer to the sky as the large bear, and the land as the small bear. It refers not to objects themselves but their relationships to each other. One object is in Bear  when it complements another in a beautiful manner. I may say I am painting in bear if all of my marks are in bear of (aesthetically complementing) the last marks. </p>
<p>it can also serve as a verb. one mark may bear another mark if it complements it.</p>
<p>the Bear may be the golden ratio, but I haven't been able to confirm this. It's easy to observe that when dividing a canvas into the first Bear, the marks will approach the golden ratio between the top and bottom of the rectangle. Things get more complicated after that. When just following one's instinct for beauty, it's hard to tell which new marks are bearing on old marks. When painting, one is rarely seeing the whole composition at once. Therefore when painting each mark in bear to the last ones, the marks take on a fractal effect as the painter goes into smaller details, since the same rule is used throughout the painting. </p>
