    <h2>Paintings</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Costs for commissioned paintings is calculated on a case-by-case basis. A small but complex painting could cost the same as a large simple one. Water based or dry media on paper is cheaper than oil or anything on a stretched canvas. The low end is a sketch on paper or a simple gouache for around $75 and the high end is a large scale oil on stretched canvas for <$5000

    <h2>illustrations</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Illustrations are done digitally at $30 an hour. A simple black and white illustration may take me 1-2 hours. complex ones 4+. I'm not taking on any more long term projects at the moment, so please keep the jobs to three images or less.

    The prices are not quotes, It's just to give you an idea of what I might charge. If you have an interesting idea but you don't have the budget feel free to reach out anyway, I won't be offended. I've been paid in eggs more than once.
