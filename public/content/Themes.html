   I have a number of themes I am exploring in my artwork. 'Lavanic' art is in its own quadrant, as is "BEAR". Other themes you may find here:
  </p>
<div>
    <ul>
      <li> Flora and Fauna - much of my art is derived from nature, and you'll find a number of studies that relate to the natural settings
  around my home in North Georgia. I'm particularly fond of Muscadines!</li>
      <li>Intuitive - I have a number of pieces that are more intuitive than representational. These are often done in gouache or watercolor.</li>
      <li>Cat - A series featuring "Cat without a stomach" and related acrylics.</li>
      <li>Ironic - Lavanic Irony is a theme that I am exploring. It is the idea that beauty is often found in the unexpected.</li>
      <li>Objective - I have a number of pieces that are more objective.</li>
      <li>Form - A number of form studies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You'll also find some galleries for specific media, such as oils, textiles, and so on.</p>
