<h1>Lavanic Art</h1>
<p>Lavanism or Yavanism is a philosophy that uses the detection of beauty in the pursuit of truth. The Lavanic idea of beauty from others in the way that it separates human perspective and preference from abstract beauty. To the lavanic eye, a human or animal or landscape is not more beautiful just because it is young or healthy or fertile. Lavanic beauty is in the arrangement of matter. Lavanic art is made by and for the practice of honing oneâ€™s detection of beauty.</p>

  <p>The text found in a lot of my artwork is a lavanic language. The letters and symbols represent the movement of matter, parallel lines represent the action of a wave, and particles the action of a particle. In that way it is very literal. It takes on more meaning in context. Lio out of context means a wave moved a particle to the right, or a wave produced a particle. As the name of a person it may mean they were given. Lioaloi out of context means a wave produced a particle, which was absorbed into a wave, the particle returns. As a name it means, they were given to be returned, they were returned. If you said it to someone, it might mean I gave you something, could you give it back now?</p>

  <p>some text looks more like characters than the english alphabet. this is the later Lavanic text. when the characters become more complex like the larger ones, the meanings become at once far more specific and also meaningless. They aren't actually meaningless, it's just that the meaning is literal. The text describes the motion of matter by drawing the motion of matter. An immense amount of context is needed for us to glean any specific meaning.</p>
