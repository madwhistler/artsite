<h2>You & Me</h2>
<p>Art is about relationships. What I create, I hope affects your experience. Art is a language of emotion and mind.
It might be easy for you to understand, or it might take some effort.</p>

<p>Please explore my collection, find works that you like, and favorite them with the little heart button. That lets me know
    about both you and my art and how I may be connecting. You can leave notes as well. You'll find your favorites nearby.</p>

<p>This quadrant is about you and me and how we relate through art. You can find out more of what I'm doing, send me
an email note with a contact form, or even leave me a little something under my Money Rock.</p>

<p>If you want to buy one of my works, I'm open to the idea, but I'm not supporting that with direct transactions here.
Let me know if one of my works really speaks to you, and we can figure out if it needs to make a journey to your home.</p>
<p>Thank you for being here! Have fun exploring!</p>
