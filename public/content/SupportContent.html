    Whenever I go out into the woods, I always look under my Money Rock to see if someone has left me some
    money and maybe a note. I never know who might have done that, but I hope they feel as good about leaving it
    as I do about finding it! I do my best to turn that money into Beauty, by getting more paints, brushes, paper,
    cloth, or whatever I need to make the next artwork.

    Your contribution is anonymous. I don't know who left money under my rock. Please don't leave money that you need
    for other things. Leave money in gratitude that I can find with gratitude. Thank you!
